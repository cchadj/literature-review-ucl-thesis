    Background It has been suggested there is a chronic neurodegenerative
  disorder, underlying the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis ({MS}), which
  is distinct from the more obvious immune-mediated attack on the white matter.
  Limited data exists indicating there is an alteration in pulse wave
  propagation within the craniospinal cavity in {MS}, similar to the findings
  in normal pressure hydrocephalus ({NPH}). It is hypothesized {MS} may harbor
  pulse wave encephalopathy. The purpose of this study is to compare blood flow
  and pulse wave measurements in {MS} patients with a cohort of {NPH} patients
  and control subjects, to test this hypothesis. Methods Twenty patients with
  {MS} underwent magnetic resonance ({MR}) flow quantification techniques. Mean
  blood flow and stroke volume were measured in the arterial inflow and venous
  out flow from the sagittal ({SSS}) and straight sinus ({ST}). The
  arteriovenous delay ({AVD}) was defined. The results were compared with both
  age-matched controls and {NPH} patients. Results In {MS} there was a 35 \%
  reduction in arteriovenous delay and a 5 \% reduction in the percentage of
  the arterial inflow returning via the sagittal sinus compared to age matched
  controls. There was an alteration in pulse wave propagation, with a 26 \%
  increase in arterial stroke volume but 30 \% reduction in {SSS} and {ST}
  stroke volume. The {AVD} and blood flow changes were in the same direction to
  those of {NPH} patients. Conclusions There are blood flow and pulsation
  propagation changes in {MS} patients which are similar to those of {NPH}
  patients. The findings would be consistent with an underlying pulse wave
  encephalopathy component in {MS}. Electronic supplementary material The
  online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12987-016-0041-2) contains

    Imaging the retinal vasculature offers a surrogate view of systemic
  vascular health, allowing noninvasive and longitudinal assessment of vascular
  pathology. The earliest anomalies in vascular disease arise in the
  microvasculature, however current imaging methods lack the spatiotemporal
  resolution to track blood flow at the capillary level. We report here on
  novel imaging technology that allows direct, noninvasive optical imaging of
  erythrocyte flow in human retinal capillaries. This was made possible using
  adaptive optics for high spatial resolution (1.5 μm), {sCMOS} camera
  technology for high temporal resolution (460 fps), and tunable wavebands from
  a broadband laser for maximal erythrocyte contrast. Particle image
  velocimetry on our data sequences was used to quantify flow. We observed
  marked spatiotemporal variability in velocity, which ranged from 0.3 to 3.3
  mm/s, and changed by up to a factor of 4 in a given capillary during the 130
  ms imaging period. Both mean and standard deviation across the imaged
  capillary network varied markedly with time, yet their ratio remained a
  relatively constant parameter (0.50 ± 0.056). Our observations concur with
  previous work using less direct methods, validating this as an investigative
  tool for the study of microvascular disease in humans.%

    Precise measurements of photoreceptor numerosity and spatial arrangement
  are promising biomarkers for the early detection of retinal pathologies and
  may be valuable in the evaluation of retinal therapies. Adaptive optics
  scanning light ophthalmoscopy ({AOSLO}) is a method of imaging that corrects
  for aberrations of the eye to acquire high-resolution images that reveal the
  photoreceptor mosaic. These images are typically graded manually by
  experienced observers, obviating the robust, large-scale use of the
  technology. This paper addresses unsupervised automated detection of cones in
  non-confocal, split-detection {AOSLO} images. Our algorithm leverages the
  appearance of split-detection images to create a cone model that is used for
  classification. Results show that it compares favorably to the
  state-of-the-art, both for images of healthy retinas and for images from
  patients affected by Stargardt disease. The algorithm presented also compares
  well to manual annotation while excelling in speed.%

    Adaptive Optics ({AO}) retinal imaging has provided revolutionary tools to
  scientists and clinicians for studying retinal structure and function in the
  living eye. From animal models to clinical patients, {AO} imaging is changing
  the way scientists are approaching the study of the retina. By providing
  cellular and subcellular details without the need for histology, it is now
  possible to perform large scale studies as well as to understand how an
  individual retina changes over time. Because {AO} retinal imaging is
  non-invasive and when performed with near-{IR} wavelengths both safe and
  easily tolerated by patients, it holds promise for being incorporated into
  clinical trials providing cell specific approaches to monitoring diseases and
  therapeutic interventions. {AO} is being used to enhance the ability of
  {OCT}, fluorescence imaging, and reflectance imaging. By incorporating
  imaging that is sensitive to differences in the scattering properties of
  retinal tissue, it is especially sensitive to disease, which can drastically
  impact retinal tissue properties. This review examines human {AO} retinal
  imaging with a concentration on the use of the Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser
  Ophthalmoscope ({AOSLO}). It first covers the background and the overall
  approaches to human {AO} retinal imaging, and the technology involved, and
  then concentrates on using {AO} retinal imaging to study the structure and
  function of the retina.%

    A spatial shift between channels in a dual-beam raster-scan imaging system
  introduces a temporal separation between images from the two channels that
  can be much shorter than the frame rate of the system. The technique is
  demonstrated by measuring the velocity of erythrocytes in the retinal
  capillaries. We used an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope and
  introduced a temporal separation between imaging channels of 4.7 ms. We
  imaged three subjects and measured changing capillary blood flow velocity at
  the pulse rate. Since the time shift between channels is easily and
  continuously adjustable, this method can be used to measure rapidly changing
  events in any raster scan system with little added complexity.%

    Retinal vascular diseases are a leading cause of blindness and visual
  disability. The advent of adaptive optics retinal imaging has enabled us to
  image the retinal vascular at cellular resolutions, but imaging of the
  vasculature can be difficult due to the complex nature of the images,
  including features of many other retinal structures, such as the nerve fiber
  layer, glial and other cells. In this paper we show that varying the size and
  centration of the confocal aperture of an adaptive optics scanning laser
  ophthalmoscope ({AOSLO}) can increase sensitivity to multiply scattered
  light, especially light forward scattered from the vasculature and
  erythrocytes. The resulting technique was tested by imaging regions with
  different retinal tissue reflectivities as well as within the optic nerve
  head.%

    {PURPOSE}: An impediment for the clinical utilisation of ophthalmic
  adaptive optics imaging systems is the automated assessment of photoreceptor
  mosaic integrity. Here we propose a fully automated algorithm for estimating
  photoreceptor density based on the radius of Yellott's ring. {METHODS}: The
  discrete Fourier transform ({DFT}) was used to obtain the power spectrum for
  a series of images of the human photoreceptor mosaic. Cell spacing is
  estimated by least-square fitting an annular pattern with a Gaussian cross
  section to the power spectrum; the radius of the resulting annulus provides
  an estimate of the modal spacing of the photoreceptors in the retinal image.
  The intrasession repeatability of the cone density estimates from the
  algorithm was evaluated, and the accuracy of the algorithm was validated
  against direct count estimates from a previous study. Accuracy in the
  presence of multiple cell types and disruptions in the mosaic was examined
  using images from four patients with retinal pathology and perifoveal images
  from two subjects with normal vision. {RESULTS}: Intrasession repeatability
  of the power spectrum method was comparable to a fully automated direct
  counting algorithm, but worse than that for the manually adjusted direct
  count values. In images of the normal parafoveal cone mosaic, we find good
  agreement between the power-spectrum derived density and that from the direct
  counting algorithm. In diseased eyes, the power spectrum method is
  insensitive to photoreceptor loss, with cone density estimates overestimating
  the density determined with direct counting. The automated power spectrum
  method also produced unreliable estimates of rod and cone density in
  perifoveal images of the photoreceptor mosaic, though manual correction of
  the initial algorithm output results in density estimates in better agreement
  with direct count values. {CONCLUSIONS}: We developed and validated an
  automated algorithm based on the power spectrum for extracting estimates of
  cone spacing, from which estimates of density can be derived. This approach
  may be used to estimate cone density in images where not every single cone is
  visible, though caution is needed, as this robustness becomes a weakness when
  dealing with images from patients with some retinal diseases. This study
  represents an important first step in carefully assessing the relative
  utility of metrics for analysing the photoreceptor mosaic, and similar
  analyses of other metrics/algorithms are needed.%

    Quantitative analysis of the cone photoreceptor mosaic in the living retina
  is potentially useful for early diagnosis and prognosis of many ocular
  diseases. Non-confocal split detector based adaptive optics scanning light
  ophthalmoscope ({AOSLO}) imaging reveals the cone photoreceptor inner segment
  mosaics often not visualized on confocal {AOSLO} imaging. Despite recent
  advances in automated cone segmentation algorithms for confocal {AOSLO}
  imagery, quantitative analysis of split detector {AOSLO} images is currently
  a time-consuming manual process. In this paper, we present the fully
  automatic adaptive filtering and local detection ({AFLD}) method for
  detecting cones in split detector {AOSLO} images. We validated our algorithm
  on 80 images from 10 subjects, showing an overall mean Dice\&\#x2019;s
  coefficient of 0.95 (standard deviation 0.03), when comparing our {AFLD}
  algorithm to an expert grader. This is comparable to the inter-observer
  Dice\&\#x2019;s coefficient of 0.94 (standard deviation 0.04). To the best of
  our knowledge, this is the first validated, fully-automated segmentation
  method which has been applied to split detector {AOSLO} images.%

    Imaging with an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope ({AOSLO})
  enables direct visualization of the cone photoreceptor mosaic in the living
  human retina. Quantitative analysis of {AOSLO} images typically requires
  manual grading, which is time consuming, and subjective; thus, automated
  algorithms are highly desirable. Previously developed automated methods are
  often reliant on ad hoc rules that may not be transferable between different
  imaging modalities or retinal locations. In this work, we present a
  convolutional neural network ({CNN}) based method for cone detection that
  learns features of interest directly from training data. This
  cone-identifying algorithm was trained and validated on separate data sets of
  confocal and split detector {AOSLO} images with results showing performance
  that closely mimics the gold standard manual process. Further, without any
  need for algorithmic modifications for a specific {AOSLO} imaging system, our
  fully-automated multi-modality {CNN}-based cone detection method resulted in
  comparable results to previous automatic cone methods which utilized ad hoc
  rules for different applications. We have made free open-source software for
  the proposed method and the corresponding training and testing datasets
  available online.%

    Images from high-resolution scanning ophthalmic instruments are
  significantly distorted due to eye movement. Accurate image registration is
  required to successfully image subjects who are unable to fixate due to
  retinal conditions. Moreover, all scanning ophthalmic imaging modalities
  using adaptive optics will benefit from image registration, even in subjects
  with good fixation and anaesthetized animals. Transformation functions used
  to map two images could in principle be very complex. Here, we show that when
  the scanning in ophthalmic instruments is sufficiently fast with respect to
  the speed of involuntary eye movement, these mapping functions become the
  addition of a linear term and a single variable function. Then, based on
  experimental data on eye movement amplitude and speed of the fixating eye,
  minimum sampling frequencies for these instruments are discussed. Finally, a
  simple method for estimating the image transformation functions by taking
  advantage of the finite bandwidth of the motion signals is presented.%

    We present a novel framework combining convolutional neural networks

  segmentation of nine layer boundaries on retinal optical coherence tomography

  specific retinal layer boundaries and train a corresponding classifier to
  delineate a pilot estimate of the eight layers. Next, a graph search method
  uses the probability maps created from the {CNN} to find the final
  boundaries. We validated our proposed method on 60 volumes (2915 B-scans)

    Retinal vessel segmentation algorithms are a fundamental component of
  automatic retinal disease screening systems. This work examines the blood
  vessel segmentation methodologies in two dimensional retinal images acquired
  from a fundus camera and a survey of techniques is presented. The aim of this
  paper is to review, analyze and categorize the retinal vessel extraction
  algorithms, techniques and methodologies, giving a brief description,
  highlighting the key points and the performance measures. We intend to give
  the reader a framework for the existing research; to introduce the range of
  retinal vessel segmentation algorithms; to discuss the current trends and
  future directions and summarize the open problems. The performance of
  algorithms is compared and analyzed on two publicly available databases
  ({DRIVE} and {STARE}) of retinal images using a number of measures which
  include accuracy, true positive rate, false positive rate, sensitivity,
  specificity and area under receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve.%

    Retinal vessel segmentation is a fundamental step for various ocular
  imaging applications. In this paper, we formulate the retinal vessel
  segmentation problem as a boundary detection task and solve it using a novel
  deep learning architecture. Our method is based on two key ideas: (1)
  applying a multi-scale and multi-level Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN})
  with a side-output layer to learn a rich hierarchical representation, and (2)
  utilizing a Conditional Random Field ({CRF}) to model the long-range
  interactions between pixels. We combine the {CNN} and {CRF} layers into an
  integrated deep network called {DeepVessel}. Our experiments show that the
  {DeepVessel} system achieves state-of-the-art retinal vessel segmentation
  performance on the {DRIVE}, {STARE}, and {CHASE}\_DB1 datasets with an
  efficient running time.%

    Vessel segmentation is a key step for various medical applications. This
  paper introduces the deep learning architecture to improve the performance of
  retinal vessel segmentation. Deep learning architecture has been demonstrated
  having the powerful ability in automatically learning the rich hierarchical
  representations. In this paper, we formulate the vessel segmentation to a
  boundary detection problem, and utilize the fully convolutional neural
  networks ({CNNs}) to generate a vessel probability map. Our vessel
  probability map distinguishes the vessels and background in the inadequate
  contrast region, and has robustness to the pathological regions in the fundus
  image. Moreover, a fully-connected Conditional Random Fields ({CRFs}) is also
  employed to combine the discriminative vessel probability map and long-range
  interactions between pixels. Finally, a binary vessel segmentation result is
  obtained by our method. We show that our proposed method achieve a
  state-of-the-art vessel segmentation performance on the {DRIVE} and {STARE}
  datasets.%

    Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the
  distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the
  parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by
  requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and
  makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We
  refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem
  by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making
  normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the
  normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to
  use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It
  also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout.
  Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization
  achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the
  original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized
  networks, we improve upon the best published result on {ImageNet}
  classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error),
  exceeding the accuracy of human raters.%

    Objective: The authors present a new method to track individual red blood
  cells ({RBCs}) as they move through capillaries. This method uses a recently
  developed Measurement and Analysis System for Capillary Oxygen Transport
  ({MASCOT}) and the concept of space–time images to track {RBCs} between
  consecutive frames of video recordings of the microcirculation. Methods: A
  space–time image displays in a single static image for a single capillary
  the location of all {RBCs} as a function of time. Analysis is performed on
  video tapes of {RBC} flow through capillaries to obtain velocity of
  individual cells as they traverse the capillary of interest. A space–time
  image is generated to track {RBCs} from one frame to the next and their
  velocities are computed. Based on the optical density values of each cell
  obtained from synchronized videotapes at two wavelengths, the oxygen
  saturation of a cell can be determined. In this manner, oxygen saturation can
  be tracked for the same cells as they move through the capillary. Results and
  Conclusions: These measurements, taken together, allow one to determine how
  much and how fast oxygen is being delivered to the surrounding tissue. This
  method provides, for the first time, a way to track individual {RBCs} flowing
  through capillary networks and study their {RBC} dynamics and oxygenation.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In many recent object recognition systems, feature extraction stages are
  generally composed of a filter bank, a non-linear transformation, and some
  sort of feature pooling layer. Most systems use only one stage of feature
  extraction in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the
  filters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode.
  This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that
  follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning
  the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the
  performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any
  advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction,
  rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include
  rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important
  ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that
  two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most
  surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield
  almost 63\% recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper
  non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with
  supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on
  {NORB} dataset (5.6\%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised
  refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 ({\textgreater} 65\%), and
  the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed {MNIST} dataset
  (0.53\%).%

    Since the retinal blood vessel has been acknowledged as an indispensable
  element in both ophthalmological and cardiovascular disease diagnosis, the
  accurate segmentation of the retinal vessel tree has become the prerequisite
  step for automated or computer-aided diagnosis systems. In this paper, a
  supervised method is presented based on a pre-trained fully convolutional
  network through transfer learning. This proposed method has simplified the
  typical retinal vessel segmentation problem from full-size image segmentation
  to regional vessel element recognition and result merging. Meanwhile,
  additional unsupervised image post-processing techniques are applied to this
  proposed method so as to refine the final result. Extensive experiments have
  been conducted on {DRIVE}, {STARE}, {CHASE}\_DB1 and {HRF} databases, and the
  accuracy of the cross-database test on these four databases is
  state-of-the-art, which also presents the high robustness of the proposed
  approach. This successful result has not only contributed to the area of
  automated retinal blood vessel segmentation but also supports the
  effectiveness of transfer learning when applying deep learning technique to
  medical imaging.%

    This paper presents a new supervised method for vessel segmentation in
  retinal images. This method remolds the task of segmentation as a problem of
  cross-modality data transformation from retinal image to vessel map. A wide
  and deep neural network with strong induction ability is proposed to model
  the transformation, and an efficient training strategy is presented. Instead
  of a single label of the center pixel, the network can output the label map
  of all pixels for a given image patch. Our approach outperforms reported
  state-of-the-art methods in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.
  The result of cross-training evaluation indicates its robustness to the
  training set. The approach needs no artificially designed feature and no
  preprocessing step, reducing the impact of subjective factors. The proposed
  method has the potential for application in image diagnosis of ophthalmologic
  diseases, and it may provide a new, general, high-performance computing
  framework for image segmentation.%

    The condition of the vascular network of human eye is an important
  diagnostic factor in ophthalmology. Its segmentation in fundus imaging is a
  nontrivial task due to variable size of vessels, relatively low contrast, and
  potential presence of pathologies like microaneurysms and hemorrhages. Many
  algorithms, both unsupervised and supervised, have been proposed for this
  purpose in the past. We propose a supervised segmentation technique that uses
  a deep neural network trained on a large (up to 400 þinspace000) sample of
  examples preprocessed with global contrast normalization, zero-phase
  whitening, and augmented using geometric transformations and gamma
  corrections. Several variants of the method are considered, including
  structured prediction, where a network classifies multiple pixels
  simultaneously. When applied to standard benchmarks of fundus imaging, the
  {DRIVE}, {STARE}, and {CHASE} databases, the networks significantly
  outperform the previous algorithms on the area under {ROC} curve measure (up
  to {\textgreater} 0.99) and accuracy of classification (up to {\textgreater}
  0.97). The method is also resistant to the phenomenon of central vessel
  reflex, sensitive in detection of fine vessels ( sensitivity {\textgreater}
  0.87), and fares well on pathological cases.%

    Purpose Alterations in leukocyte velocity have been implicated in many
  retinal disease processes. However, direct and objective assessment of
  leukocyte velocity in retinal capillaries has been limited by a reliance on
  invasive contrast dyes that allow leukocyte visualization only for a short
  time span. The recent application of adaptive optics in a scanning laser
  ophthalmoscope ({AOSLO}) has made long-term imaging of parafoveal leukocyte
  movement possible without contrast dyes. In this study, using the {AOSLO}, we
  demonstrate a new method to investigate retinal parafoveal capillary
  leukocyte velocity. Design Experimental study. Participants Six normal
  healthy subjects ranging from 25 to 35 years of age with clear ocular media.
  Methods The parafoveal zone of the retina was imaged in all subjects using an
  {AOSLO}. Main Outcome Measures Leukocyte velocity was determined in the
  parafoveal capillaries including the foveal avascular zone border. Leukocyte
  velocity was measured directly from movie segments in which the leukocytes
  were clearly visible. Results The mean parafoveal leukocyte velocity for 6
  subjects was 1.37 mm/second, ranging from 0.77 to 2.10 mm/second. Leukocytes
  were not visible in all parafoveal capillaries. Conclusions Parafoveal
  capillary leukocyte velocity can be directly and noninvasively measured
  without the use of contrast dyes using an {AOSLO}.%

    The use of adaptive optics ({AO}) in a confocal scanning laser
  ophthalmoscope ({AOSLO}) allows for long-term imaging of parafoveal capillary
  leukocyte movement and measurement of leukocyte velocity without contrast
  dyes. We applied the {AOSLO} to investigate the possible role of the cardiac
  cycle on capillary leukocyte velocity by directly measuring capillary
  leukocyte pulsatility. The parafoveal regions of 8 eight normal healthy
  subjects with clear ocular media were imaged with an {AOSLO}. All subjects
  were dilated and cyclopleged. The {AOSLO} field of view was either 1.4×1.5
  degrees or 2.35×2.5 degrees, the imaging wavelength was 532nm and the frame
  rate was 30fps. A photoplethysmograph was used to record the subject's pulse
  synchronously with each {AOSLO} video. Parafoveal capillary leukocyte
  velocities and pulsatility were determined for two or three capillaries per
  subject. Leukocyte velocity and pulsatility were determined for all eight
  subjects. The mean parafoveal capillary leukocyte velocity for all subjects
  was Vmean=1.30mm/s ({SD}=±0.40mm/s). There was a statistically significant
  difference between leukocyte velocities, Vmax and Vmin, over the pulse cycle
  for each subject (p{\textless}0.05). The mean pulsatility was Pmean=0.45
  (±0.09). Parafoveal capillary leukocyte pulsatility can be directly and
  non-invasively measured without the use of contrast dyes using an {AOSLO}. A
  substantial amount of the variation found in leukocyte velocity is due to the
  pulsatility that is induced by the cardiac cycle. By controlling for the
  variation in leukocyte velocity caused by the cardiac cycle, we can better
  detect other changes in retinal leukocyte velocity induced by disease or
  pharmaceutical agents.%

    Purpose. Increased leukocyte-endothelium interaction have been suggested as
  a phenomenon contributing to capillary occlusion and/or rupture of the
  blood-retina barrier during human retinal vascular diseases. This study was
  performed to evaluate if fluorescein-labeled autologous leukocytes ({FLALs})
  can be used for examination of leukocyte transit in the human retina.
  Methods. The preparation consisted of human dextran-separated leukocytes
  mixed with fluorescein. After reinjection in normal subjects and in one
  diabetic patient, a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope was used to
  visualize them in the retinal circulation. The changes between {FLALs} and
  control leukocytes in the expression of leukocytes adhesion molecules {CD}11b
  and {CD}62L were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results. The circulating
  {FLALs} were clearly visible in retinal vessels. The mean (± {SD})
  capillaries velocity was 1.43 (± 1.3) mm/s in the macula and 1.82 (± 1.4)
  mm/s in the peripapillary area. No leukostasis was detected in the normal
  subjects, while it was detected in te diabetic patient. Flow cytometry
  revealed an increase in {CD}11b and a decrease in {CD}62L expression of
  leukocytes after labeling, suggesting that compared to normal leukocytes
  {FLALs} are more susceptible to interact with vascular endothelium.
  Conclusions. The use of {FLAL} is presently the only technique applicable in
  humans for study of leukocyte transit in the retina. Their preparation is
  technically simple and unexpensive. Precise measurement of the velocity of
  leukocytes in small vessels can be obtained. Despite evidence of a certain
  degree of leukocyte activation after the labeling procedure, no leukostasis
  was detected in vivo in normal subjects. Potential applications for this
  technique may include the detection of leukostasis in the human retina during
  severe forms of diabetes and retinal phlebitis.%

    The retinal and cerebral microvasculatures share many morphological and
  physiological properties. Assessment of the cerebral microvasculature
  requires highly specialized and expensive techniques. The potential for using
  non-invasive clinical assessment of the retinal microvasculature as a marker
  of the state of the cerebrovasculature offers clear advantages, owing to the
  ease with which the retinal vasculature can be directly visualized in vivo
  and photographed due to its essential two-dimensional nature. The use of
  retinal digital image analysis is becoming increasingly common, and offers
  new techniques to analyse different aspects of retinal vascular topography,
  including retinal vascular widths, geometrical attributes at vessel
  bifurcations and vessel tracking. Being predominantly automated and
  objective, these techniques offer an exciting opportunity to study the
  potential to identify retinal microvascular abnormalities as markers of
  cerebrovascular pathology. In this review, we describe the anatomical and
  physiological homology between the retinal and cerebral microvasculatures. We
  review the evidence that retinal microvascular changes occur in
  cerebrovascular disease and review current retinal image analysis tools that
  may allow us to use different aspects of the retinal microvasculature as
  potential markers for the state of the cerebral microvasculature.%

    In this paper, we explore and compare multiple solutions to the problem of
  data augmentation in image classification. Previous work has demonstrated the
  effectiveness of data augmentation through simple techniques, such as
  cropping, rotating, and flipping input images. We artificially constrain our
  access to data to a small subset of the {ImageNet} dataset, and compare each
  data augmentation technique in turn. One of the more successful data
  augmentations strategies is the traditional transformations mentioned above.
  We also experiment with {GANs} to generate images of different styles.
  Finally, we propose a method to allow a neural net to learn augmentations
  that best improve the classifier, which we call neural augmentation. We
  discuss the successes and shortcomings of this method on various datasets.%

    The blue field entoptic phenomenon consists of the perception of one’s
  own leukocytes (white blood cells) flowing in the macular capillaries of the
  retina. A method has been developed for determining the speed of the
  leukocytes. In this method, the motion of the leukocytes is simulated on a
  screen by means of a minicomputer system. The subject is instructed to match
  the motion of the simulated white blood cells with that of his own
  leukocytes. For this, he can adjust the number and the maximum and minimum
  speeds of the simulated particles. Measurements in five young subjects with
  normal fundi indicate that the speed of the leukocytes in the macular
  capillaries of the retina is pulsatile. Minimum and maximum speeds are
  approximately 0.5 and 1 mm/s.%

    There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires
  many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network
  and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to
  use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture
  consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding
  path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be
  trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method
  (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the {ISBI} challenge for
  segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the
  same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast
  and {DIC}) we won the {ISBI} cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories
  by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512
  image takes less than a second on a recent {GPU}. The full implementation
  (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at

    \field{abstract}{%
    The pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia is traditionally understood in
  relation to reductions in cerebral blood flow ({CBF}). However, a recent
  reanalysis of the flow-diffusion equation shows that increased capillary
  transit time heterogeneity ({CTTH}) can reduce the oxygen extraction efficacy
  in brain tissue for a given {CBF}. Changes in capillary morphology are
  typical of conditions predisposing to stroke and of experimental ischemia.
  Changes in capillary flow patterns have been observed by direct microscopy in
  animal models of ischemia and by indirect methods in humans stroke, but their
  metabolic significance remain unclear. We modeled the effects of progressive
  increases in {CTTH} on the way in which brain tissue can secure sufficient
  oxygen to meet its metabolic needs. Our analysis predicts that as {CTTH}
  increases, {CBF} responses to functional activation and to vasodilators must
  be suppressed to maintain sufficient tissue oxygenation. Reductions in {CBF},
  increases in {CTTH}, and combinations thereof can seemingly trigger a
  critical lack of oxygen in brain tissue, and the restoration of capillary
  perfusion patterns therefore appears to be crucial for the restoration of the
  tissue oxygenation after ischemic episodes. In this review, we discuss the
  possible implications of these findings for the prevention, diagnosis, and
  treatment of acute stroke.%

    Microscopic features of the human retina can be resolved noninvasively
  using an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope ({AOSLO}). We describe
  an improved method to track and quantify the speed of moving objects in
  {AOSLO} videos, which is necessary for characterizing the hemodynamics of
  retinal capillaries. During video acquisition, the objects of interest are in
  constant motion relative to the background tissue (object motion). The
  background tissue is in constant motion relative to the {AOSLO}, due to
  continuous eye motion during video recordings (eye motion). The location at
  which {AOSLO} acquires data is also in continuous motion, since the imaging
  source is swept in a raster scan across the retina (raster scanning). We show
  that it is important to take into consideration the combination of object
  motion, eye motion, and raster scanning for accurate quantification of object
  speeds. The proposed methods performed well on both experimental {AOSLO}
  videos as well as synthetic videos generated by a virtual {AOSLO}. These
  methods improve the accuracy of methods to investigate hemodynamics using
  {AOSLO} imaging.%

    Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy was used to noninvasively
  acquire videos of single-file flow through live human retinal parafoveal

  dynamics. Certain capillaries accounted for a clear majority of leukocyte
  traffic (Leukocyte-Preferred-Paths, {LPPs}), while other capillaries

    The cause of Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is unknown. This gap in knowledge
  has created a stumbling block in the search for a genuinely effective
  treatment or cure for this dementia. This article summarises the arguments
  for a causal role for either amyloid deposition or cerebrovascular pathology
  as the primary trigger in the development of non-genetic {AD}. A bare-bones
  survey of the published research reveals no compelling evidence that amyloid
  deposition is neurotoxic in human beings or that it results in
  neurodegenerative changes involving synaptic, metabolic, or neuronal loss in
  human or transgenic-mouse brains. By contrast, the data supporting {AD} as a
  primary vascular disorder are more convincing. Findings suggesting a vascular
  cause of {AD} come from epidemiological, neuroimaging, pathological,
  pharmacotherapeutic, and clinical studies. The consensus of these studies
  indicates that chronic brain hypoperfusion is linked to {AD} risk factors,
  {AD} preclinical detection and pharmacotherapeutic action of {AD} symptoms.%

    Arterial hypertension is known to be an important risk factor for cerebral
  and cardiovascular disease. Previous studies in rats have demonstrated that
  changes in both capillary density and vessel diameter may contribute to
  increased vascular resistance in hypertension. In vivo studies of human
  subjects with essential hypertension revealed a reduction in the number of
  arterioles in the skin and conjunctiva; no other in vivo data are available
  from other tissues. By means of a new imaging technique, capillary density
  and capillary blood flow velocity can now be assessed in the human retina. We
  undertook the present investigation to determine whether patients with
  essential hypertension and only minor clinical retinal vascular alterations
  have decreased retinal capillary density and altered capillary flow velocity.
  Seventeen hypertensive patients with only minor retinal vascular alterations
  and 17 healthy volunteers matched for age were selected. All study
  participants underwent ophthalmologic examination and fluorescein
  angiographic studies by means of scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. Capillary
  density and capillary blood flow velocity in the perifoveal network were
  evaluated from the angiograms. The retinal microcirculation in the perifoveal
  capillary network of hypertensive patients showed significant alterations.
  Both the capillary density and capillary flow velocities were significantly
  reduced compared with the control group. For the first time alterations of
  capillary blood flow and capillary density in a vascular network very similar
  to that of the brain have been demonstrated in hypertensive patients in vivo.
  Further studies with this technique may help identify patients at high risk
  for cerebrovascular diseases.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Purpose: The purpose of the study is to disclose the nature of fluorescent
  dots and segments traditionally observed with fluorescein angiography ({FA})
  using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope ({SLO} 101; Rodenstock, München,
  Germany). The authors developed a new method, called fluorescein leukocyte
  angiography ({FLA}), to display directly the movement of leukocytes in human
  retinal vessels. Methods: Fluorescein angiography was performed on two normal
  volunteers using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope and fluorescent dots and
  segments were observed. Fluorescein leukocyte angiography, using an injection
  of fluorescent buffy coat layer from which the fluorescent plasma and
  nonfluorescent erythrocytes have been removed externally, was performed on
  seven normal volunteers. Injection fluid smears were examined through a
  fluorescent microscope. Peripheral blood smears taken during midphase of {FA}
  and {FLA} also were examined. In addition, 15 early-phase {FAs} of central
  serous chorioretinitis ({CSC}) were studied retrospectively. Results: In the
  {FAs} of normal volunteers, fluorescent dots were detected only in
  perimacular capillaries at early phase. Eight of the 15 {CSC} {FAs} examined
  showed both fluorescent dots and segments. In the {FLAs}, fluorescent dots
  were detected in whole retinal vessels for more than 30 minutes. Fluorescent
  segments were observed in {FA} but not in {FLA}. Injected fluid smears from
  one {FLA} showed fluorescent leukocytes and small platelets. However, in
  peripheral blood smears of the {FLA}, leukocytes and platelets were more
  visible and exhibited higher contrast than those of an {FA} due to background
  plasma fluorescence. The mean velocity of 21 flowing leukocytes in perifoveal
  capillaries was 1.37 ± 0.35 mm/second in 2 {FAs} and that of 89 flowing
  leukocytes was 1.41 ± 0.29 mm/second in 7 {FLAs}. Conclusions: The authors'
  observations suggest that fluorescent dots in scanning laser ophthalmoscope
  imaging are fluorescein-stained leukocytes, whereas fluorescent segments are
  the hyperfluorescent plasma that is located between rouleaux formations of
  erythrocytes. The velocity of the fluorescent dots could be measured in the
  perimacular capillaries by either {FA} or {FLA}; however, only {FLA} can
  display the flow of fluorescent leukocytes in large vessels.%

    In vivo measurement of retinal blood flow is obtained by measuring the
  blood velocity of erythrocytes and lumen diameters of the blood vessels using
  an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Erythrocyte velocity is
  measured by tracking erythrocytes moving across a horizontal scanning line.
  This approach provides high temporal bandwidth measurements, allowing the
  fluctuation of blood flow during cardiac cycles to be measured. The technique
  is most applicable to medium-sized blood vessels.%
